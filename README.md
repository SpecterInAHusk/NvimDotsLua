# my_nvim_dotfiles
Just my Neovim dotfiles, feel free to use them as inspiration. They'll change as I learn more about Neovim

## Notes
* For lightline, I use a custom color scheme called deuscustom. To use it, just copy it from the backup folder to the appropriate folder in the lightline directory.

* The lua directory currently contains configurations I'm still setting up for the future
