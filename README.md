# NvimDotsLua
Just my Neovim dotfiles, feel free to use them as inspiration. They'll change as I learn more about Neovim

## TODO
* Migrate from init.vim to init.lua
* More lazy loading
* Format some stuff
* Add Ultisnips path for custom snippets
* Put plugin settings in their own files and require them when the plugins are loaded
* Update README
* Try nvim-lsp + nvim-cmp + lspsaga + lspinstall, replace coc-nvim and ALE
